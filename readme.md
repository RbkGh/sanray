# SanRay
SanRay is an illegal youtube video downloader that runs cross platform mac,windows and linux.

## Why?
We think youtube should allow videos to be downloaded from their website.<br>

Q:Why don't we use online video downloaders?<br>
A:it's cool but most of them if not all,want to take some cash(We understand them though)<br>

Q:Why do we need another youtube video downloader when there are so many?<br>
A:Come on,we are tired of ads and restrictions on the video quality we can download.
and guess what? [@youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) is only in the console

Q:What if we could have a simple and functional interface that leverages on the work of [@youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl)?<br>
A:This is where SanRay comes in.

#NB
San comes from the subscript of CEO of youtube's name,Susan<br>
and Ray is [@mcroni's](https://github.com/mcroni) best female friend(_let's take it like that_)

## TODO 
* Url bar with download button
* Customizable storage location of downloaded videos
* And more
